AWS CloudFormation Challenge for MiniClip
========================================

Hello, i thought it would be a nice idea to use the excelent readthedocs and sphinx to write a small README
to go along with the challenge.

I hope this way, you'll have some fun reading it, and at the same time have no problems testing the solution
and be well informed about the choices i've made.
